Calc(ium)ulator is a fun and simple way to educate people on how to maintain a healthy, calcium-rich diet.

This project was made during **[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)**'s Design for Good Hackathon and won first place. It was made with love by Kevin Wu, Jordeen Chang, Charles Xue, and Varun Rau.

**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to our desire to see social good enacted in our community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
